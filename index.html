      <p>Salmon cookies were originally created by hungry college students who had no prior culinary experience. One day a group of students got together and baked cookies with smoked salmon. It started as a Friday night fun activity, but the news spread out the entire campus that the combination of smoked salmon and cookies are incredible. Soon it was a cover story on Times magazine and it started like that.</p>
      <p>Currently there are five locations where you can visit and purchase your favoriate salmon cookies. The store opens from 6am to 8pm. Single salmon cookie costs $15.00 but you can have 90% discount when purchase 5 or more at once.</p>
